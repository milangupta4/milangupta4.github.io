I read Tolstoy's novels - War and Peace and Anna Karenina in my teens. Although I haven't revisited his novels since. 
Other than that Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov is an old favorite.  

In 2021, as I begin my life post-MBA at IIM Lucknow, I have resolved to read a book a week, and update my blog with a book review.
