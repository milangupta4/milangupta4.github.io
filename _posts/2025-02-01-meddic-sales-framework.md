For companies that rely on complex Sales motions in B2B, a systematic approach to understanding their ICP is critical. 

If you are selling a B2B product, you must know that at any point you are competing with 3-4 other companies that are trying to sell a similar solution.

Therefore, to succeed in completing a sale, you need to :
1. Accurately solve your buyer's problems
2. Get in front of the actual decision-maker
3. Convince internal advocates for usage & adoption

MEDDIC framework makes these factors into a coherent picture. 

Originally developed at PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation) in the 1990s, MEDDIC has become the gold standard for B2B sales qualification, particularly in high-value, complex sales scenarios.

## What is MEDDIC?

MEDDIC is an acronym that stands for Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, and Champion. This methodical framework helps sales teams assess the viability of opportunities. 

With this detailed understanding of the prospect's buying process, Sales reps can develop strategies to win deals.

### Metrics
Metrics quantify the potential value and impact of your solution. 

For example, a cybersecurity software selling solutions to Enterprises would focus on metrics like:
- Reduction in security incidents (e.g., 60% decrease in breach attempts)
- Time saved in threat detection (e.g., from 6 hours to 30 minutes)
- Cost savings from automated security responses ($500,000 annually)

A workplace document platform like Notion may focus on metrics such as:
- Cost per user saved on using multiple different tools (say 60% drop in costs on using different tools)
- Increased adoption because only a single tool is used (say 20% increased adoption)

A metrics-first approach places the focus on the problem being solved. For the buyer, the decision comes down to - would they like to invest in solving this problem?

### Economic Buyer
This is the person with the authority and budget to make the final purchasing decision. For instance, in a CRM implementation project, the VP of Sales or the Chief Revenue Officer will be the key decision maker.
- Title: Chief Revenue Officer
- Budget Authority: Can approve purchases up to $2M
- Key Concerns: Revenue growth, sales team efficiency, customer retention

### Decision Criteria
These are the formal and informal factors that influence the buying decision. A cloud migration project might consider:
- Technical requirements (scalability, security, compliance)
- Financial requirements (TCO, ROI timeline, payment terms)
- Vendor requirements (market presence, support infrastructure, implementation expertise)

### Decision Process
This maps out how the organization makes purchasing decisions. For example, an enterprise software purchase might follow this path:
1. Technical evaluation by IT team (2 weeks)
2. Security review (1 week)
3. Procurement team negotiation (2 weeks)
4. Legal review (1 week)
5. Final executive approval (1 week)

### Identify Pain
Understanding the prospect's challenges and their impact on the business. For an HR software implementation:
- Current Pain: Manual onboarding takes 2 weeks per employee
- Business Impact: Delayed productivity, HR team overwhelmed
- Cost of Inaction: $200,000 annually in lost productivity

### Champion
Your internal advocate who has both influence and something to gain from your solution's success. A strong champion typically:
- Has organizational influence
- Understands the pain points intimately
- Can navigate internal politics
- Has a personal stake in the project's success
