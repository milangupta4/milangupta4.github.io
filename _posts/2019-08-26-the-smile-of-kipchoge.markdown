What is it like to run a marathon?  
What goes through the runners mind?  
There is exhilaration  
There are nerves  
There is doubt  

“Can I power through at this pace”  
It’s about putting your finger in the candle flame  
It’s about testing yourself through that moment of truth  
It’s about rediscovering your basic instinct for survival  
That’s what the smile is about  

It’s a signal  
It says I am in control  
It says I am thriving on the knife’s edge  
It says I am absolutely killing it
