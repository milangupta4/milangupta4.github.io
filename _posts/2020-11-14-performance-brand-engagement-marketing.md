Performance Marketing – Designed to achieve maximum ROI (measured in sales in short-term).  
Some digital marketing activities that can be clubbed under performance marketing would be:   
YouTube bumper ads  
Sponsored searches at destinations close to Consumer’s purchase decision – Amazon, App Store
Advertising on Branded Search on Google  
Affiliate programs  
Paid promotions on Social Media 

Brand marketing on the other hand entails developing the brand, and thereby the mindshare the product has in the mind of the consumer. While building the brand is a much slower process, the size of brand is the single biggest driver of Marketing RoI. This is because, the bigger the brand, the likelier it is going to turn up in the consumer’s mind when making the purchase decision.  

Some Brand-building digital marketing activities would be:  

Website Optimization for high SEO ranking  
Social Media handles on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter  
Influencer marketing  

While Performance & Brand Marketing are mainstay approaches to non-Digital, CRM marketing is uniquely enabled by digital marketing. Examples of this would be:\

Targeted advertising campaigns based on customer analytics

Personalized Email marketing
