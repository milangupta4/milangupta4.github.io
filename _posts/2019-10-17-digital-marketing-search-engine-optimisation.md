This article is written as a introductory article for new professionals who want to have a bird's eye view of digital marketing.  

Marketing is fundamentally about presenting your product/ services to potential customers. Step 1 is to understand where your customers are - are they spending their online time searching Google, or they are on LinkedIn, Instagram, Tiktok or Facebook?

## Search Engine Optimization

The reason Google is so important for marketers is that the Google search query signals a strong intent from the user. A user searching for "Hair serum" is clearly at least evaluating Hair serums they can purchase. 

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) becomes the activity where you identify specific high intent keywords that users are searching on Google, and then optimize your website so that you rank high for those keywords.

Achieving good Search Engine Optimisation for your website requires you to:  

1. Create quality content that visitors would want to read   
2. Deliver a good website experience  
3. Backlinks - the more other good quality domains give links to your websites, the higher is your website ranking on Google

Google Analytics is the holy grail by which to evaluate digital marketing initiatives.  

1. Acquisition – People coming to your website  
2. Engagement – How users are spending time on your website
3. Conversions – How many users are converting - say purchasing your product or taking a trial
