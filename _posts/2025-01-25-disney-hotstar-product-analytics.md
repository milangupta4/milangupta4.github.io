Disney + Hotstar is an OTT application, that streams Disney content exclusively, and in addition has licenses to broadcast a number of sports, including premier league. They have different types of customers amongst their base. Hotstar is looking to drive subscription revenue further, through a mix of acquisition strategies, retention strategies and in addition identify alternative revenue streams (say Ads for non-premium users)

Disney+Hotstar has the 2nd highest number of paid subscriptions in India. Prime Video, which is bundled alongside Amazon Prime delivery service, has a total of 66 million subscribers in India.

Disney + Hotstar has 34 million subscribers

In 3rd Netflix has about 30 million subscribers (Netflix reports subscription stats for APAC at 57 million. Assuming that India’s 500mn strong internet population contributes to 50% of that number. Netflix is considerably more expensive than other competitors such as Hotstar, Prime Video & JioCinema).

Hotstar also has an ARPU of $1.05 - the contribution here comes from across subscription usage and advertising usage.

Acko has run a sticky insurance campaign around Sports content such as Premier League. Those contents have higher potential for ARPU compared to cricket, which is more suitable for broad-based products.

Note: The goal here is to showcase the metrics that a business like Disney + Hotstar would be considering. The goal here is to merge metrics thinking with Business & Customer contexts.

There will be 3 tracks along which we review metrics:

1. **Funnel metrics** - Acquisition, Activation, Engagement, Retention & Conversion, referrals - Top metrics at different levels of the user funnel, from acquisition to revenue
2. **Content Engagement** - how are users interacting with content; helpful in decisions regarding content, recommendations & search
3. **Segment-level metrics**
    1. Platforms -
        1. Where are the customers viewing the content - are they viewing on Television, or on Mobile, or on PCs;
        2. What are the viewership patterns like
    2. Geography
    3. Content viewership groups
    4. Cohorts according to signing up

## Funnel Metrics

We review

### Acquisition

1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tracks marketing effeciency most effectively. 
    
    CAC is most effectively used in comparison to Lifetime value (LTV). The minimum LTV to CAC ratio for a consumer business starts at 3:1.
    
2. New Users acquired basically captures just how effective marketing team has been. This metric can be broken across 
    1. New app installs across Android & iOS
    2. New account creation on Hotstar

### Engagement

1. Monthly Active Users (MAU) - This is the one metric that should be at the top of any Consumer PMs mind. MAU is a core health indicator of platform engagement.
    
    In one number, it captures the overall user acquisition and retention effectiveness
    
    It can be segmented by user cohorts (sports fans, movie enthusiasts, family viewers)
    
2. Advertising Revenue (for non-premium users) - Advertising revenue reflects content partnerships (in-video ad placement) and programmatic ad insertions (marketplace model).
    
    User segmentation is critical in advertising revenue, as ad packages are priced on the basis of how attractive customers are to potential advertisers.
    
    For example, Cricket on IPL will have fairly low CPMs, as the audience is very diffuse.
    
    English premier league, with its English speaking fanbase, would have a higher CPM, reflecting the viewer’s higher affinity to purchase.
    

### Retention

1. Churn Rate indicates customer satisfaction and content relevance.

Ideal churn rate for OTT is <5% monthly

Like with every metric, segment analysis by content type, demographics and subscription tier are critical. Churn is  a warning system for customer dissatisfaction, and needs to be treated as a key priority.

### Revenue

1. **Subscriber Conversion Rate** 

This measures the effectiveness of converting free users to paid subscribers. This metric will inform decisions such as partnerships to acquire users through partner channels, or improved pricing models to capture customers who are looking to view specific product categories.

Here segmenting this by user segments according to content genres watched is important.

1. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) -** 

This is a direct indicator of financial health of the business. It tracks which subscription tiers are most effective.

It includes revenue from across multiple offerings - subscriptions and ads. While Hotstar does not have any addition Pay-per-view or additional Gated content, these may be further opportunities for the business.

## Content Engagement -

These metrics will help understand content investment strategy. Understanding which content consumers are watching more, and whether they are completing them will be the ultimate guides to content acquisition and to decisions regarding original content production (Hotstar Specials)

1. Content Engagement - at a per user level
- Watch time per user
- Content completion rates
- Genre-specific engagement rates

1. Sports Viewership Metrics -  
    
    This is critical for maintaining Hotstar’s competitive edge in sports broadcasting. Peak concurrent viewers during live sports events may be a vanity metric, but it underlines the overall brand visibility of Hotstar, and can serve to reactivate dormant users.

### Cross-sectional Engagement

1. Platform Retention Rate
    
    A classic cohort analysis by subscription type can reveal if customers are increasing their usage of Disney + Hotstar over time.  
    
    A consistent retention over 30-day, 90-day, and annual retention rates suggests that users are regularly deriving enjoyment from viewing Hotstar.
    
2. Cross-Platform Engagement
    
    This helps optimize user experience across multiple platforms, and informs decisions on tech & UX.
    
    - User activity across devices (mobile, web, smart TV)
    - Session frequency and duration by platform
    - Helps optimize user experience and platform development
    - Guides technology investment decisions
