Zepto has revolutionized Quick Commerce sector in India. Powered by an outstanding Product, Tech and on-ground logistics operations, Zepto has achieved $3 billion in Annualized Gross Order value.

For context on its growth - Zepto hit $1 bn Annualized GOV only 9 months earlier in April 2024.

Zepto is marching towards a target of opening 1000 dark stores across the country. The instant delivery app currently serves over 10 Lakh (1 million) orders per day.

In addition, Zepto has launched Zepto Cafe - a quick food delivery service - and has achieved 50,000+ daily orders within the first month of launch.

## Value Proposition

Zepto seeks to make online purchase from their app the default user behavior. 

New users join in largely to order high frequency consumer goods & food items. However, through their catalog and promotions, Zepto seeks to increase ARPU by pushing higher-value products. Selling high-value products makes more sense, as profits are more likely in those categories.

## Importance of Search

Search (alongside Recommendations) is one of the most important features in new product discovery for ecommerce apps.

The customer seeks to see options that are relevant to what they are looking for. They also need some criteria by which to judge a good product.

In that context, pain points related to Search are:

### Search Intelligence ###
- Inaccurate capture of user intent
- Poor handling of misspellings and variants

### Results Page ###
- Irrelevant or poorly ranked results
- Even the results
- Missed opportunities for upselling and cross-selling
- Limited product discovery

## So, what comprises Search as a feature

### 1. Search Input
Features such as Auto-suggest and Popular searches are most common in search experiences. For Zepto, Auto-suggest becomes more important.

### 2. Search Intelligence
Search Intelligence describes whether the intent of the user is accurately captured by the search algorithm. Search tools & libraries such as Algolia, ElasticSearch & Typesense offer NLP packages that make it easier to synthesize what the user is looking for.

### 3. Search Results
Showcasing Product cards with relevant details and easy actionables becomes more critical.

### 4. Enhancements to Search Results
Ranking algorithms, in addition to promotion of complementary products and suggesting bundle packages. Enhancements in particular has very strong potential for upselling.
