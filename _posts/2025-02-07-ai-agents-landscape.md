LLMs Meet APIs.

That's my understanding of what an AI Agent is.

So, why can't a single LLM do everything? Why doesn't ChatGPT come in and destroy the entire SaaS landscape?

One of the fundamental principles of prompt engineering is that chained prompts are more powerful than a single prompt. 

And, a lot of those specific jobs needs to be on specific data. 

For example a Cloud incident detection platform will be combing through specific logs on Cloud services such as AWS, Azure or GCP ChatGPT is not specificallydesigned for reading logs

With Agentic workflows, you can create workflows by leveraging distinct GPTs.

## Different agents give different formats

Another principle to prompt engineering is that specifying formats for your LLMs gives you more control over the output.


## LLMs

Deepseek, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI are the most popular LLMs.

The AI agent landscape in 2025 represents a dynamic fusion of advanced language models, adaptive training techniques, and transformative real-world applications. Below, we explore three critical pillars shaping this ecosystem.

## 1. Leading LLMs Powering Modern AI Agents
The market features a diverse array of large language models, each optimized for specific tasks:

| Model | Developer | Parameters | Key Features |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| DeepSeek R1 | DeepSeek | 671B | Top-tier reasoning for math/coding, open-source, cost-effective training |
| GPT-4o | OpenAI | Unknown | Multimodal (text/image/voice), 2x faster than GPT-4, Voice-to-Voice latency <320ms |
| Claude 3.5 | Anthropic | Unknown | 200K token context window, superior coding/vision capabilities |
| Llama 3.1 |   Meta | 405B | Open-source, 15T token training, 128K context |
| Qwen2.5-Max | Alibaba | Undisclosed | Low-latency performance, excels in code generation and forecasting |
| Grok-2 | xAI | 314B | Open-source, integrated with X (Twitter), MoE architecture |


## 2. Building Private GPTs: RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

For businesses such as CRMs & Vertical SaaS businesses, LLMs provide different types of opportunities to create specialized GPTs. 

Now more than ever before, having proprietary rich data is a competitive advantage. HR-tech software such as Leena AI has been able to create their own private GPT, called WorkLM, on top of which workflows to answer HR queries can be created.

If you are building a private GPT, you have to decide between RAG & Fine-Tuning.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation involves two distinct steps.
1. Storage of special context data in a vector database. Using tools such LangChain and LlamaIndex, you can do appropriate chunking & vectorization of your data. Vectorization is basically creating a vector representation of your data - the text data is converted into a vector of numbers, called embeddings. For a private GPT, this process would require more significant effort. This is because the retrieval process adds context to the LLM - therefore adding the right context is critical
2. The Generation part relies on an existing LLM - this can be via an API call to OpenAI or Anthropic models, or this can be an LLM privately hosted on your own servers.

**Pros:**

Cost-effective updates (no retraining)

Reduces hallucinations via real-time grounding

Ideal for compliance-heavy sectors (e.g., healthcare, legal)

**Cons:**

Slower latency due to retrieval steps

Requires robust vector database management

### Fine-Tuning
How it works: Retrains base models (e.g., GPT-4) on domain-specific datasets.

**Pros:**

Higher accuracy for niche tasks (e.g., legal jargon)

Faster inference after initial training

Preserves data privacy (no external queries)

**Cons:**

Expensive GPU/TPU requirements

Risk of overfitting to training data

Decision Matrix:

Scenario |	Recommended Approach
Dynamic data (e.g., news) |	RAG
Specialized terminology |	Fine-Tuning
High query volume |	Hybrid (RAG + FT)

## 3. Transformative Use Cases for AI Agents

### Customer Experience

Sales: AI agents like Find AI automate lead generation with 98% precision.

Support: Chatbase reduces ticket volumes by 65% via refund automation and troubleshooting.

### Healthcare

Diagnostics: Google’s AI agent detects skin cancer with 85.4% sensitivity.

Surgery: Robotic systems assist in precision procedures.

### Autonomous Systems

Vehicles: Waymo’s self-driving cars use utility-based agents for real-time decisions.

Manufacturing: LG’s EXAONE 3.0 generates Python code for assembly line optimizations.

### Marketing & Insights

Personalization: Cisco’s AI agents analyze 140K-token customer journeys for hyper-targeted campaigns.

Competitor Analysis: Talkdesk agents track churn drivers and emerging market trends.

## Agentic Workflows, Sustainability - in terms of compute costs & Regulatory compliance are set to be the themes for 2025
The AI agent ecosystem will see three key shifts in 2025:

**Agentic Workflows:** Tools like Copilot Studio will let non-technical teams build custom agents.

**Sustainability:** Microsoft’s green AI initiatives aim for carbon-negative data centers.

**Regulatory Alignment:** RAG’s traceable sourcing will dominate GDPR/CCPA-compliant deployments.

From open-source giants like Llama 3.1 to enterprise-grade RAG pipelines, AI agents are no longer experimental—they’re redefining industries through scalable intelligence.
