LLMs Meet APIs.

That's my understanding of what an AI Agent is.

So, why can't a single LLM do everything? Why doesn't ChatGPT come in and destroy the entire SaaS landscape?

One of the fundamental principles of prompt engineering is that chained prompts are more powerful than a single prompt. 

And, a lot of those specific jobs needs to be on specific data. 

For example a Cloud incident detection platform will be combing through specific logs on Cloud services such as AWS, Azure or GCP ChatGPT is not specificallydesigned for reading logs

With Agentic workflows, you can create workflows by leveraging distinct GPTs.

## Different agents give different formats

Another principle to prompt engineering is that specifying formats for your LLMs gives you more control over the output.

## Your AI Agent architecture is similar to your Org structure

I have led a marketing team. This is what the team looked like:
1. Content analyst who would review top keywords, check out competition, and give content recommendations to content writers.
2. Content writers would write content for the blog, with the goal for it to rank well in search, capture high-intent traffic, and convert those to leads.
3. Data analyst who would prepare reports on content performance - for example how ranking for specific keywords has changed over time, and what pages have driven the most amount of traffic.
4. SEO Lead would review the overall content and the metrics, and perform lead qualification on Hubspot CRM

Well, all of that can now be done by an AI Agent.

So, instead of using tools like Ahrefs, Google Sheets, Hubspot via their interface - your tools will be talking to each other via APIs.

Different workflows will need different responses from their agents. 

## Orchestration frameworks

Langchain is the most popular orchestration framework.

## LLMs

Deepseek, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI are the most popular LLMs.
