Gong is the tool that handles the operational stuff, while enabling the Enterprise to solve the real intelligence problems.

### **The Story**

Gong.io was founded in 2015 by Amit Bendov and Eilon Reshef, both serial entrepreneurs with deep roots in SaaS and enterprise technology. The founders identified a critical pain point in sales and revenue operations: traditional CRM systems required manual data entry, often leading to incomplete or inaccurate insights.

To solve this, Gong built an AI-driven platform that captures and analyzes customer interactions—calls, emails, and meetings—automatically, providing actionable insights to sales teams. By removing the reliance on manual input and focusing on real-world data, Gong promises to help businesses drive more revenue through data-driven decision-making.

The name "Gong" reflects the company's vision of clarity—similar to a gong cutting through noise—aligning with its mission to help companies focus on what matters in their revenue processes.
