I have led a marketing team. This is what the team looked like:
1. Content analyst who would review top keywords, check out competition, and give content recommendations to content writers.
2. Content writers would write content for the blog, with the goal for it to rank well in search, capture high-intent traffic, and convert those to leads.
3. Data analyst who would prepare reports on content performance - for example how ranking for specific keywords has changed over time, and what pages have driven the most amount of traffic.
4. SEO Lead would review the overall content and the metrics, and perform lead qualification on Hubspot CRM

Well, all of that can now be done by an AI Agent.

So, instead of using tools like Ahrefs, Google Sheets, Hubspot via their interface - your tools will be talking to each other via APIs.

Different workflows will need different responses from their agents.
