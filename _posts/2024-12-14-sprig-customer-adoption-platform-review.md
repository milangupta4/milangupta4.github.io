---

We had over 300 Blocker bugs in Production.

And items were getting added to our roadmap faster than we could say Prod Stability.

We wanted to bring 10 million MAUs with a super app integration. We wanted a unique feature in enabling 4K screen share. Our classroom app would have interactive elements inside of the screen.

All this time, product stability was suffering terriby. Anecdotally, everyone knew that there were issues. We would be on customer calls, and they'd be talking about how teachers get kicked out of meetings.

But we just didn't have the hard metrics. Because we were not actually measuring anything.

We looked to design a solution that would help us measure user happiness.

We designed a "Report a Problem" feature to get a better sense of user experience. We would be inviting users to give feedback. 

We did this an year after the product was launched. Having this insight from Day 0 could have made a world of difference in decision-making and in advocating for changes.

And that is where User Testing category as a whole comes in, and where Sprig has emerged as the trendiest new tool.

### Sprig is the cool new kid in the modern Product stack

Fast-forward to now. We’ve heard of Notion & Figma & Linear and how they are superpowering product teams. And that’s pretty cool. There’s either of Amplitude or Mixpanel for Actionable product analytics.

### ICPs - Product & Design teams

The first stakeholders to any user testing tool are the PMs & Design teams. 

The beauty with Sprig is that you can incorporate User feedback to your app on the very day of launch.

When I designed “Report a Problem”, we benchmarked over 20+ Consumer & SaaS tool such as Uber, Microsoft (OneNote) and Zoom.

Then we thought deeply on what questions we wanted to ask. If the user gave a low rating, we needed to link those to the error codes that our system generates.

And of course the problem of building this out.

Now with Generative AI, creating code blocks is so much cheaper. What is not cheap is creating experiences that work with customers. That continues to be a feedback-driven process

**Key Decision Makers** - The key decision makers ultimately come down to CPO/ Head of Product / CTO, depending on the org structure.

**Key Influencers** - Engineering

### Two pillars of Customer Feedback - Quantitative and Qualitative

The fundamental insight with Amplitude & Mixpanel is that in lean product teams, PMs should have much faster time-to-insights.

There are 2 things any analytics platforms are capturing:

1. Who is the user
2. What are they doing - event logging.

Amplitude & Mixpanel have a very opinionated approach to what it is that users measure. So they are not just a tool, they are actually guiding product teams.

And that’s what Sprig is now doing with qualitative user feedback.

### What Sprig enables you to do

1. In-app feedback & surveys
2. Heatmaps & Session replays
3. AI Explorer & AI Recommendations

### You can get a User survey running within 30 minutes, and then refine further on it

For any feedback, there are three aspects:

1. Target - Who is to be targeted - is it based on some event in your app
    
    > We mainly use Sprig for surveys on our existing customer base segmented by audience. The filters really help us determine what segment we want to survey and on what pages. I also really like Sprig's AI analysis of open answers and how it clusters them into themes. https://www.g2.com/products/sprig/reviews/sprig-review-9735733
    > 
2. Design
3. Analysis

> I think that the way the feedback is collected and categorized is really helpful. All the tasks that you need to test your survey participants on are recorded and transcribed instantly, and if you enable screen recording, you are able to view their pathing and see in real time, if they're struggling in specific areas of your designs. Also, Sprig has the responses to the questions automatically categorized into themes that highlight the key takeaways from the survey. All in all, it makes it really easy to review all of the feedback coming in and saves me so much time with synthesizing the data. I am definitely going to be using Sprig from now on to conduct user interviews and usability tests with my customers.

### SaaS differs in how easy it is for users to use your product

1. **Minimum time to realize value** - the fundamental difference between a SaaS tool and an Open Source library is that SaaS tools have a productized-layer, in which they’ve solved for customer adoption

> My company primarily utilized Maze, to which we were highly attached. Maze was exceptionally user-friendly (for designers), and features such as hotspots proved to be extremely valuable for our data interpretation. Sprig offers a similar yet distinct set of functionalities, so making the decision to switch was not a quick one. To address our concerns, the product team convened a formal meeting with representatives from Sprig before finalizing our decision.
> 
> 
> One aspect of Sprig that I particularly appreciate is their customer support, which effectively addressed my numerous inquiries—something I did not experience with Maze. Additionally, Sprig frequently conducts webinars and provides one-on-one customer support, which has significantly enhanced my ability to efficiently use its tools.
