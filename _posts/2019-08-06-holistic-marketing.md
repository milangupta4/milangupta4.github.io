What is holistic marketing?
- **Internal Marketing** – All functions of the business should be geared towards serving the marketing objectives of the firm.
- **Integrated Marketing** – All communication from the firm should be synchronized
- **Relationship Marketing** – Customers Employees, Marketing partners (suppliers, distributors), and Financial Community
- **Performance Marketing** – Relevant metrics should be measured, beyond the basic sales, which is a lagging indicator. Customer acquisition costs and customer retention are some metrics that firms should keep a close eye on.
