### When viewing performance over the last decade, the top 6 is indeed relevant

The average position of the Top 6 clubs - Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea, over the period 2015-16 to 2023-2024 is less than 6.
The next club - West Ham, has an average league position of 10.6

### Manchester City have the lowest Matchday revenues, but the most commercial revenues

The new deal 9.5 years deal with Erling Haaland runs till 2034. 

The significance of the deal is multi-fold

Secures the status of the top forward in Premier League with Manchester City

Gives Manchester Commercial teams a flagbearer around which to build their Commercial strategy

And given how Haaland is continuing to live to his Elite standards, the deal makes superb sense.
