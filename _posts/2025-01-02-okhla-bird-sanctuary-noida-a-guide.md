Okhla Bird sanctuary is an under-rated escape from the city. It is one of the very few spots in Delhi where the natural beauty around Yamuna river is accessible to the general public.

### NCR has its own Marine drive

Well, not quite. 

There is a seated parapet besides an expansive water body. And that's where the comparisons with Marine drive end.

If you are looking for a quiet place to walk or to just to contemplate life, Okhla bird sanctuary is indeed a good place.

The 2.5km walking track continuously gives changing views of the Yamuna river, replete with birds swimming on the water and Jungle babblers babbling & angrily chirping.

### How to reach?

There are 2 gates, one at each end of the road along the Yamuna river barrage. 

One entry is near the Kalindi Kunj bridge, near the appropriately named Okhla Bird Sanctuary metro station.

The other entry is from the Chilla border between Noida and Delhi, on the road between the Akshardham temple and Noida film city. If you're coming by car, I would recommend this entry as there is ample parking space. There is no paid parking as such and no parking attendant. But if you're coming in the morning, you'll find plenty of other cars parked on the road. 

If you're coming from Noida, then just before the Delhi border, take a left turn on the bird sanctuary road. Continue straight for 1.5kms - you will pass a Shani mandir on your right, then the DND Toll offices, a cow shelter, and finally you'll drive under an overbridge, and then you'll reach the Okhla Bird Sanctuary gate. 

The Map below is the most accurate listing of the gate.

### Key details about the park

Okhla Bird sanctuary is open around the year. It is closed on Mondays. The timings of the park at 7am - 5pm, and at the entry you are charged Rs. 30 for entry.

The absolute best time to visit is in the mornings, when the park is quiet and the birds are active.

The Bird Sanctuary itself is a 2.5km walk along the Yamuna river barrage, of which 2kms is on a well-paved road free of traffic, and 500 metres is on a well-maintained trail.

An e-rickshaw service also operates inside the park premises, transporting visitors from one end of the park to the other end for a fees.






### The History

This was a general-access road till the late 90s. For travel from Noida to Faridabad, and from there southwards towards Agra, this was the most accessible road. 

Around the end of 90s, this was converted into a gated preserve, even as other infrastructure projects facilitated travel between Noida-Delhi-Faridabad. 

The lake is actually the reservoir from the barrage downstream at Okhla barrage. If you're unlucky, they may open the barrage to release water, and you'll be left with a muddy / non-existent lake.

### Conservation & birds status

In the mornings you will find walkers from Noida, and during the day you will often come across day-trippers from around NCR. Because there is always some activity happpening, reptiles such as snakes are unlikely to be stumbling around your path. 

To be ultra-safe, whenever unsure, make loud noises to signal to any animal that you are around the corner.
