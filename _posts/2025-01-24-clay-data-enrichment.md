Imagine fishing with a blindfold and a broken net. You don't know if you are targeting the right thing. And even if you have hit upon the right fish, there's no guarantee it will be caught in the net.

I want to highlight the importance of data enrichment for Sales & Marketing teams with this rather crude metaphor. 

Each unverified contact is a missed connection, and each outdated email is a potential revenue roadblock. Precision means having the data about the ICP that will most help you to converting them.

Within that context, Clay offers a robust ecosystem of data enrichment sources.

Clay's core offering is platform where you can upload your leads, and enrich them from multiple data sources. 

With Clay, businesses gather comprehensive insights about leads, contacts, and potential customers. Here I go through the most frequently used enrichment data sources.
