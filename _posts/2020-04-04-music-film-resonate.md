The right music adds such an important layer to the stories. When it resonates, it becomes so much more than some of its parts. So what are the best examples I have seen:
1. The Departed – Gimme Shelter
The Departed opening scene – I love The Rolling Stones in Scorses’ films. Rolling Stones are like the bad boys to the sweet boys of The Beatles. I love how the song segues in from “No one gives it to you, you have to take it”
2. Hotel Chevalier – Where Do You Go To, My Lovely
This one from Wes Anderson is legendary. Where Do you go to my Lovely
(Bit of a misogynist song to be honest, but seems so romantic in the film)
3. 2001: A Space Odyssey – Blue Danube
This one, Echoes synced with the Jupiter and Beyond section of 2001: A Space Odyssey, certainly makes so much sense
4. Goodfellas – Then He Kissed Me
Layla – The piano part, amplifies the tragedy. That final shot as the camera zooms in on a meat truck with Frank Carbone deep frozen that it took them 2 weeks to thaw him out!
And then he kissed me – The defining shot of the film, as Henry Hill takes Susan to the restaurant amidst an almost comical scene of the kitchen
5. Barry – Cómo Me Quieres
In Barry, Cómo Me Quieres by Khruangbin was perfect. I listened to this every morning, as I walked from my flat to gym in cold Gurgaon winter mornings. Just like in the show, there’s something like a resignation that this song captures. Beautiful
6. Twin Peaks – Laura’s Theme
Talking of shows, Laura Theme’s in Twin Peaks is so amazing! So sad and uplifting.
7. Amelie
Amelie. What an utterly lovely film. The kind that puts a nice bright smile on your face. God this film deserves a bigger review!
8. Grand Budapest Hotel
🙂 Here’s Mr Moustafa. The film’s a visual treat!
9. The Big Lebowski – The Man in Me
The Man in Me, Bob Dylan. Because its Dylan. And the song captures the character so very well. I didn’t realize until I was listening to a Dylan radio that this was a Dylan song. 🙂
10. Pulp Fiction – Misirlou
Pulp Fiction, well the entire film, but here’s Misirlou. I also love the The Lonely Shepherd in Kill Bill
11. The Lost Sheep – Fargo
Its amazing how this song conveys a sense of futility of the complicated things in life.
12. Trainspotting – Perfect Day
Amazing film. The film is a celebration of drug use, but one that clearly tells you where addiction leads to. The song is so beautiful. It was also the one that introduced me to Lou Reed, so amazing stuff.
