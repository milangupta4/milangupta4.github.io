T2D3 is a growth model for Sales-driven SaaS companies articulated by Neeraj Agrawal, General Partner at Battery Ventures. It is essentially a benchmark for SaaS companies to demonstrate sustained success and scalability to investors.

The model cites the examples of Salesforce, [ServiceNow](/blog/servicenow-saas-success-story), Workday and Zendesk as companies that have grown by T2D3 standards.

## Introduction to T2D3
T2D3 is a growth benchmark that stands for Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double over five years. 

Specifically, it aims for a company’s revenue to grow at a compounded rate, tripling its revenue each of the first two years and then doubling it each of the next three years.

## Product Marketing Fit & Getting from 0-1

The first step is about finding product-market fit. At this stage, successive customer interviews focused on customer's pain points and adoption are key. The goal here is to understand the urgency of the customer problem, and how well the shipped product solves for it.

The T2D3 growth model applies after the product-market fit has been established by the company. 
The model considers $2 million ARR as the starting point at which the company can seek to apply T2D3 framework.

## Breaking Down T2D3
**Years 1-2 (Triple Each Year):** Achieving a 3x revenue growth each year, culminating in a 9x increase after two years. A revenue of $2mn at the start of this period would result in revenue of $18mn at the end of Year 2.

**Years 3-5 (Double Each Year):** Following up with 2x annual growth, leading to a 72x increase from year 1 to year 6.

This model serves as a structured roadmap, encouraging startups to focus on aggressive yet sustainable growth metrics that are attractive to venture capitalists and other investors.

## 3 Startups and how they grew

Examining real-world examples of startups that have either achieved or approximated the T2D3 growth trajectory provides valuable insights into the model's applicability and effectiveness.

### Slack

Slack's unique design choices, integrations and cross-platform accessibility made it amongst the most successful SaaS companies in 2010s.

In 2017, Slack launched Enterprise Grid to target large organizations, securing clients like IBM.
Acquired by Salesforce in 2020 for $27.7B, Slack now integrates deeply into enterprise workflows, serving over 344,000 customers globally by 2025.
