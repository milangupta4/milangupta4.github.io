This is a photo-essay of my experience at Solang Skyrun, 30km category.  

Heading into the race I was pretty nervous and excited. There’s something about being in the mountains. Its the sense that you are amidst something majestic, something so much bigger than you.  

The race route largely comprised trails. The idea of being on a remote trail, away from people naturally raised plenty of thoughts and worries. In the end, I approached this as a trek on steroids. My experience of Pangarchulla Peak trek showed me that I am fitter than most people that go on guided treks. I figured I might just as well make my next move and start running on trails.  

Priority 1 was to not get injured. In fact priority 1 was to get home safely. This was fairly well accomplished. I returned with only a few bruises, and the ‘running season’ went well as I achieved my PB at Airtel Delhi Half Marathon.

This smile lasted the entirety of the 30km of the run. I was so bloody excited, and the experience totally surpassed expectations.

The second stretch of the run, as we approached Jogini falls from the Manali-Leh highway. The fun was only beginning.

The death climb. This took me about an hour, and all my training and preparation really paid off here. I emerged to lead the middle pack of runners. I kept the position of seventh for the rest of the race after overtaking 20-30 people on the ascent.

The elevation gain achieved was over 1000+ metres in less than 5km. Physically it was the toughest part of the race – the stair-like route was steep. I fell and bruised my legs quite a bit. While climbing I was worrying a bit about exhausting myself, worrying that I had pushed myself too hard. But I still had plenty in reserve.

For much of the run this Mountain panorama was right beside me. You know what's better than sitting down and admiring a mountain panorama? It is to run with that view :)

Scratched, bruised, and high. That scream of accomplishment when I crossed the finish line!  

I feel [The Hell Race](https://www.thehellrace.com/trail-race/solang-skyultra/) folks did a pretty good job in organizing the run. The route was safe, the markings were adequate, and I got sufficient water and food throughout the run to sustain myself.

Stupid grin on realizing what I had just accomplished! 5 hours 10 minutes of pure, joyous, persistent effort. If only life itself was that easy!

I studied this race route well before the race, which helped me avoid surprises. I knew the route profile in terms of the ascents and the descents. The only part that stumped me was the fact that at the very last there would be an ascent from the Beas river to the Solang village, and even worse, it would be along the tarred road in full 12 noon Sun.

I loved Hotel Iceland. The food was amazing. This is me in the morning. The feeling before the race, of confidence in preparation, and nervous excitement at the uncertainty of the course! That's beautiful.


Here’s another one from Ursula Le Guin:  

> I am not trying to say that I was happy, during those weeks of hauling a sledge across an ice-sheet in the dead of winter. I was hungry, overstrained, and often anxious, and it all got worse the longer it went on. I certainly wasn’t happy. Happiness has to do with reason, and only reason earns it. What I was given was the one thing you can’t earn, and can’t keep, and often don’t even recognize at the time; I mean joy.
