I have built and grown outstanding products across Jio Platforms (Head of Products) and VdoCipher & Spyne  (Head of Marketing).

I completed my MBA from IIM Lucknow in 2021, where I spent much of my time running around the beautiful campus.

Winning the Best Athlete Award at the IIML Farewell. I would like to thank my family, the campus loop, the two sightings of porcupines, the snakes who've never made themselves visible to me, the peacocks who run away as I chase them in search of a protein-rich meal, and most of all my college-mates for not throwing eggs at me as I run past them.

The highlight of my time at IIML. I feel so fortunate to have met such an amazing personality as Romil sir!

What a feeling as I crossed the finish line! I was trailing until the very very last. Thankfully my tactics worked, as my consistent pace gave me enough to power through at the finish. I love shouting at the end of races, as it just lets me relieve all the mental tension that's built up during the run!
